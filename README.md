# hello-world
This is my First GitHub Repository "hello-world" created as part of DataScience specialization signature track course from Coursera. Many more to come by the time I finish the most valued course. Having worked with Oracle (SQL, PL/SQL, APEX & ODI) & C throughout my career, looking forward to learn DataScience technologies and BigData.
